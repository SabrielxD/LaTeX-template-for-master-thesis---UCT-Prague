Amino acids are one of the most important substances in living organisms either in their free form or in peptides and proteins. Determination of amino acids is used in many fields - e.g. in medicine for diagnosing an illness or a metabolism disorder, in food industry for disclosure of food origin and for detecting food and drink falsification or for \textit{in-vivo} observation of neurotransmitters. 

In this work several techniques which are used for analysing samples are presented chronologically - ion-exchange chromatography (IEC), reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and capillary chromatography.

For detection of analytes mostly spectroscopic methods are used in modern separation techniques. Amino acids show weak absorption and fluorescence. To obtain better detection sensitivity a derivatization agent is added to a sample. Analytes are transformed to better detectable derivatives (e.g. substances with higher fluorescence yield). Derivatization is performed either before separation (pre-column derivatization), directly in column or in capillary (in-column derivatization), or after separation (post-column derivatization).

This work describes several derivatization techniques which take advantage of reaction of amino acids with carbonyl compounds. Derivatization agents that are presented here are: nin\-hyd\-rin, ortho\-phthal\-al\-de\-hy\-de (OPA), na\-phtha\-le\-ne-2,3-di\-carb\-ox\-al\-de\-hy\-de (NDA), 3-(2-furoyl)chi\-no\-li\-ne-2-carb\-ox\-al\-de\-hy\-de (FQCA), 3-(4-carboxybenzoyl)chi\-no\-li\-ne-2-carb\-ox\-al\-de\-hy\-de (CBQCA), 3-(4-bro\-mo\-ben\-zo\-yl)chi\-no\-li\-ne-2-carb\-ox\-al\-de\-hy\-de (Br-BQCA) and 3-(4-chlo\-ro\-ben\-zo\-yl)chi\-no\-li\-ne-2-carb\-ox\-al\-de\-hy\-de (Cl-BQCA). In some cases derivatization reactions and products are shown.
